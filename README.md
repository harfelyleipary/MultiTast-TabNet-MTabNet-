# MultiTask-TabNet-MTabNet-
The Multitask Tabular Neural Network developed in this study uses the TabNet architecture as a shared feature extractor to learn deep representations from cross-country tabular data, then divides the prediction pipeline into two separate output heads to predict two SDGs indicators simultaneously, namely Goal 1 (No Poverty) and Goal 4 (Quality Education). This multitask approach allows the model to exploit the natural interrelationships between socio-economic indicators, making the learning process more efficient, accurate, and able to capture general patterns and specific characteristics of each target. With an attentive masking-based feature selection mechanism, the model remains interpretative while also excelling in performance compared to traditional tabular models, making it a more robust solution for forecasting sustainable development indicators globally.
